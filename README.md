# CSS-Grid-Image-Gallery

A project in HTML5 CSS3 JavaScript to practice the what I've learned recently in CSS (CSS Grid and CSS3)

It's a reproduction of a cssgrid.io example but reproduced without looking at his solution.

## Edit

I tried to use Sass to nest classes in classes so this project became also an opportunity to learn Gulp. So all this website is compiled in the build folder when you run 'Gulp build'.

The css and the javascript files are minified and concatenated.
